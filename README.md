# CMPT 376W Assignment 3
<br/>

## Criteria
For this project, assume the reader has prior background knowledge of Computer Science and Prototyping. The goal of the README.md is to instruct Professor and Teaching Assistants (TAs) in using the system. It must include the team number and the full names of each member.
In the words of the Professor:
> "The README is just for helping us figure out how to run your project. It doesn't have to be too extensive.
>
> Since many of you are using different types of software and different versions, just make things easy for us and clearly state what you used. A lot of tools now allow you to generate a web-based link for your prototype so you can just share that, but again, make it clear which is the first screen we should be looking at."

# Synitheia Prototypes

A habit-forming application prototyped on Figma by Team 2 (Name 1, Name 2, Name 3, Name 4 Name 5)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Steps

* Navigate to the appropriate link (found in the subsection of this document). This will open the project file. No download or installation is necessary. Internet connection is required.

* Click the play button on the top left corner to get started with presentation mode.

This will activate the project and will start on the proper landing page. More details regarding
the specifics are below.

* Explore the available options on the screen. If stuck, click anywhere on the screen and available options will be highlighted in blue:

### Navigation Notes

There are several items to keep in mind while navigating through the prototypes.

__Text boxes...__

are rounded grey boxes. Due to the constraints of Figma, typing interactions were not able to be as fluid. Therefore, to type into a textbox. Simply click on the textbox and the project will navigate as though the information was typed out

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
