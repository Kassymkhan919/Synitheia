# CMPT 376W Assignment 3
<br>

## Criteria
For this project, assume the reader has prior background knowledge of Computer Science and Prototyping. The goal of the README.md is to instruct the Professor and Teaching Assistants (TAs) on how to start the created prototypes. This file **must** include the team number and the full names of each member.
In the words of the Professor:
> "The README is just for helping us figure out how to run your project. It doesn't have to be too extensive.
>
> Since many of you are using different types of software and different versions, just make things easy for us and clearly state what you used. A lot of tools now allow you to generate a web-based link for your prototype so you can just share that, but again, make it clear which is the first screen we should be looking at."

This differs from the rubric given for CMPT 376W's Assignment 3 greatly. As such, the given rubric has been remodeled to illustrate the changes. 

#### The Original
*Introduction*
* Motivation
* Task Description
* Objective
* Describing task as a machine learning problem

*Problem Analysis*
* User Requirements
* Userâ€™s Goals

*Project Management*
* Software Development
* Programming Language(s) Used
* Development Platform

#### The New Rubric
*Introduction*
* Team Number
* Team Member's Full Names 
(These have been replaced with arbitrary "Name #"s due to the submission guidelines of Assignment 3: *"[submissions] should not include your name or student number in the pdf"*)
* Software Used
* Clear general instructions as to how to open and operate the prototypes

*Horizontal Prototype*
* Working link to prototype
* Clear description of starting screen
* List of major user tasks implemented (in order)

*Vertical Prototype*
* Working link to prototype
* Clear description of starting screen
* Description of what feature is vertical
* To what extent is the verticality implemented?

# Synitheia Prototypes

A habit-forming application prototyped on **Figma** by Team 2 (Name 1, Name 2, Name 3, Name 4, Name 5)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Steps

* Navigate to the appropriate link (found in the subsection of this document). This will open the project file. No download or installation is necessary. Internet connection and a Figma account are required.

* The link will open the prototype's starting page. No furthur steps are required to open the project.

* Explore the available options on the screen. If stuck, click anywhere on the screen and available options will be highlighted in blue:

### Navigation Notes

There are several items to keep in mind while navigating through the prototypes.

* __Text boxes...__

![Grey text box](https://i.imgur.com/r8qFPXr.png
 "Text box")
 
...are rounded grey boxes. Due to the constraints of Figma, typing interactions were not able to be as fluid. Therefore, to type into a textbox simply click on the textbox and the project will navigate as though the information was typed out.

<br/>

* __Back buttons...__

![Back button](https://i.imgur.com/RQzW9Hh.png
 "Back button")
 
...are used to navigate users back to the proper screen if they wish to cancel their actions. Once again, due to Figma constraints, the back button may not navigate back to the page expected. This is a rare occurance, but one to keep in mind while exploring Synitheia.
