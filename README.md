# Synitheia Prototypes

A habit-forming application prototyped on **Figma** by Team 2 (Nicole Vavrukh, Erica Ho, Grace Luo, Kassymkhan Bekbolatov, Harry Cui)

The target file for this Readme.md can be found [here](https://github.com/Kassymkhan919/Synitheia/blob/master/README.md)

## Getting Started

The below steps will get a copy of the project running on the browser.

### Steps

* Navigate to the prototype’s link (found in the subsection of this document) to open the project file. No download or installation of the project is necessary. Internet connection and a Figma account are required

* The link will open the prototype’s start page. 

* Explore the available options on the screen. Pressing any part of the screen highlights available options in blue:

### Navigation Notes

Several items to consider while navigating through the prototypes:

* __Text boxes__ are rounded grey boxes. Typing interactions were not available on Figma. To “type” into a text box, click on the text box and the interaction will be simulated with the correct information.

<br/>

* __Back buttons__ bring users to the prior screen if cancelling an action. Due to Figma’s constraints on the interaction feature, the back button may not show the expected page. The issue is a rare occurrence to be aware of.

### How Vertical Is the Prototype?

**Checking In**
* If user checks in and presses "No" on the prompt...
  * If it's the final check in, send a prompt letting users push back the deadline by 2 (two) weeks or more
  * If it's a regular check in, send an encouraging message meant to motivate the user and break the current streak
  
* If user checks in and presses "Yes" on the prompt...
  * If it's the final check in, send a "Congrats!" message and move the habit goal into Completed section
  * If it's a regular check in, send a confirmation message and either increase the streak or start a new streak for that habit goal

<br>

**Creation of habit goal**

*When user starts creating a habit:*

* Error messages appear when user tries to proceed by scrolling down without completing the current stage 
* Message prevents user from selecting a habit-forming period of less than 2 weeks
* There are 3 branches depending on what type of check-in period is chosen: Daily, Weekly or Custom
* Unclickable buttons/options are lighter or “greyed out”

<br>

*On the calendar integration screen:*

If user chooses to integrate their calendar...
* Users can select/deselect times in the found time screen
* Error message appears when user attempts to click on unhighlighted regions in the found time screen
* There are 2 branches depending on what type of calendar is integrated, physical or digital

If user does not choose to integrate their calendar...
* There are 2 branches depending on whether users would like to set reminders to do the habit or not

<br>

*Empty Screens*

* There are two types depending on whether it is the user's first time viewing the home screen or not
